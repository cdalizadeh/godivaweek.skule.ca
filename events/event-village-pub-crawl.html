		<p>Join a band of intrepid engineers on their jaunt through the queerest part in Toronto! During the Crawl skuligans visit the gay village at Church and Wellesley, dancing and drinking their way through a curated selection of fabulous bars and clubs. This event is a great way for participants to see a part of Toronto they might not usually visit, and for people familiar with the area to show their friends just what make it so great.</p>
		<p>Also, there will be a best chest competition for interested parties.</p>
		<p>Logistical details and event updates will be provided on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/395718584203613/">event Facebook page.</a></p>
