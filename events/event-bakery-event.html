		<p>Ever wonder at the marvel that is a perfectly decorated cake? Have you hesitated to bite into a cupcake, not wanting to disrupt the perfect swirl of icing sitting atop it? Delighted at the variety of brightly coloured cookies in a shop window? Youâ€™re not alone! Here at Mario's Bakery, we love the joy and wonder brought out in all of us by a sensationally decorated pastry. Join us for an afternoon to learn about the exciting field of pastry artistry and to do some activities which may or may not be completely unrelated to it. As with a box of cupcakes, this event is non-refundable. Fortunately, it is also free.</p>
