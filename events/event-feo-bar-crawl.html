		<p>Hey everyone! Hope you're ready to head out to a bar or three. This Saturday, we'll be meeting up in the pit and going to drink and eat and make merry at one or more undisclosed locations!</p>
		<p>Additionally this event will serve as the official unofficial time-honored tradition of "56 days until FeO", although of course the event is still meant for everyone and it's just one more excuse to come out and have a fun night.</p>
		<p>We'll be trying not to make the walk very far, but regardless be sure to dress warmly, and come thirsty. See you then!</p>
