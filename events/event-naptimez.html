	<div>The coziest, sleepiest, cuddliest event of Godiva Week is back for round 2! NAPTIMEZZZ is a place to relax after a week of celebration and in anticipation of the coming hell that will be second semester. Stop by the pit from 1 to 2 to cuddle up next to some friends, listen to chill music, and drink hot chocolate. Blankets and beds will be provided but you can bring your own pillows or stuffed animals if you wish.</div>
