		<p>Already stressed out from class? Have some pent-up demons but no way to get them out? Enjoy helping out awesome charities like <a href="https://www.rainbowrailroad.ca/">Rainbow Railroad</a>? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then come out to the charity car smash and help empower the LGBT community by hitting an old car with large hammers. Sounds fun, right?</p>
		<p>We'll be auctioning off hits during the event, so bring some cash and prepare for some carnage :)</p>
