	<div>Skule has a legacy worth celebrating, a legacy that has been 145 years in the making. The Skule Legacy tour presents a unique opportunity to explore Skule's legacy and discover how it has evolved from the times of the Little Red Schoolhouse to Godiva Week. This tour will take place in the Rare Books Fisher Library in Robarts at 3 PM. Please meet us in the PIT at 2:50, so we can walk there together.</div>
